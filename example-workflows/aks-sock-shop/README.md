# Deploy Sock Shop demo to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)       

This sample workflow deploys the [Weavework's Sock Shop demo](https://microservices-demo.github.io/) to the [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/).
The workflow first provisions a Azure Resource Group, then deploys an AKS cluster into the Resource Group. 
Next, the workflow creates a namespace on top of the AKS cluster and then deploys the Sock Shop demo into it. 
Finally, the workflow provides a manual approval before exposing the front end service to the internet.
